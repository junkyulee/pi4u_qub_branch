PNDL (MPI version)

Description:

The numerical estimation of derivatives at several accuracy levels
is a common requirement in many computational tasks, such as optimization,
solution of nonlinear systems, etc. The parallel implementation
that exploits systems with multiple CPUs is very important
for large--scale, computationally expensive problems.

Finite differencing is used with carefully chosen steps
that minimize the sum of the truncation and cancellation errors. The parallel
versions employ the OpenMP and MPI platforms.

The software takes in account bound constraints, in
the sense that only feasible points are used to evaluate the
derivatives, and given the level of the desired accuracy, the
proper formula is automatically employed.
