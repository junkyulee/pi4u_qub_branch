We provide a task-parallel version of the NSGA-II multiobjective algorithm.
We have introduced minimal modifications to the original sequential code
developed at Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (KanGAL, IIT Kanpur) by
the authors of the algorithm [(C) Dr. Kalyanmoy Deb 2005, see the Notice file].

You can find more information about the NSGA-II code in the Readme file, 
which has been slightly modified to include any changes introduced in the
original code. 


The following compilation options are supported:
- make use_omp=1		# builds the OpenMP version
- make use_torc=1		# builds the TORC-based version
- make use_omp=0 use_torc=0	# builds the serial version
- make				# builds the serial version

If you have any questions about the parallel version of this code, 
please feel free to contact Dr. Panos Hadjidoukas (phadjido at mavt.ethz.ch)
